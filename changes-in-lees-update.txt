- removed unused imports

- exceptions named ending in "Error"

- no arguments that hide built-ins (like "input")

- make some args excplicit to built-ins

- use context manager for open()

- use commas for all members of array, including last one

- don't catch exception "as e:" then ignore it.

- don't need "elif" or "else" after a return

- remove unused variables

- use f-strings

- use list comprehension? (not done yet)

- "magic" values (some are left)

- have 2 spaces between functions/classes

- have spaces around '=' for assignment statements, but no spaces for attributes

- added a test/ subdir and a single test (so far), using unittest
  (and a doc to explain it a bit)



PROBLEMS NOT YET SOLVED

- too many branches

- to many lines in a function

- some magic values are a mystery to me, so leaving them alone

- lines too long (who cares)

- using shell=true in run_command: need to add an optional "dir" argument?

- all the cool "typing" stuff

- setting mode 755 for patch directory? really?
