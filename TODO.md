# Things to do for patchtools

Started when moving to pyproject.

Keep track of things from reviews, and other changes.

## other

### run pylint

Pylint isn't as good as ruff, but it's useful none the less.

Run with pylint. Might want to create a pylint config file?

Not sure if it can be integrated with pyproject? Or if it'd
be worth it.

## from review

### fix README comment on install

Do not suggest just writing to /usr/local. Use "--user"?

### squash COPYING commits

This file was created first as an Apache-2.0 file, then
changed to GPL-2.0. Squash those two commits for that
file.

### sequence unit test creation before other changes

Not sure this will help ???
